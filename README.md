To install, simply clone or download .zip. The server part is a formality for uploading to a VPS server.

After cloning/unpacking the project, open up your terminal. Navigate to the client directory ("cd client" when in the parent directory). Then make sure to have installed the required dependencies by typing: -npm install. Launch the project on your local machine on the same port as its given in the server.js file via constant PORT (feel free to adjust manually).
